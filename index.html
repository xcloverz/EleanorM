		<h1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h1>
		
		<h2>by Jane Taylor, 1806</h2>
	
		<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
		How I wonder what you are!<br>
		Up above the world so high,<br>
		Like a diamond in the sky!</p>
		
		<p>When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
		When he nothing shines upon,<br>
		Then you show your little light,<br>
		Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.</p>
		
		<p>Then the traveller in the dark,<br>
		Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
		He could not see which way to go,<br>
		If you did not twinkle so.</p>
		
		<p>In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
		And often through my curtains peep,<br>
		For you never shut your eye,<br>
		Till the sun is in the sky.</p>
		
		<p>As your bright and tiny spark,<br>
		Lights the traveller in the dark,â€”<br>
		Though I know not what you are,<br>
		Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</p>
